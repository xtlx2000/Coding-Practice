描述
You are given a sequence of integers, A = a1, a2, ... an. A consecutive subsequence of A (say ai, ai+1 ... aj) is called a "repeated sequence" if it appears more than once in A (there exists some positive k that ai+k = ai, ai+k+1 = ai+1, ... aj+k = aj) and its appearances are not intersected (i + k > j).

Can you find the longest repeated sequence in A?

输入
Line 1: n (1 <= n <= 300), the length of A.
Line 2: the sequence, a1 a2 ... an (0 <= ai <= 100).

输出
The length of the longest repeated sequence.
